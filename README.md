# sneaky-snake
Classic Snake game in pure ES6 JavaScript. No 3rd party library dependency.

## Browser support

All modern desktop browsers (read -- no IE support) - see https://caniuse.com/#search=es6.
Mobile browsers could be supported if only anyone could be bothered to implement game controls for them.

## Acknowledgement

The game algorithm is not optimal. The code is not the most feng-shui. 
But hey! I've got nothing better to do and made this!
